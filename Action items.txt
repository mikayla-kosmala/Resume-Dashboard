"""
Action items
separate your code into files
    Is there supposed to be a purpose?

X separate your code into functions

create a class for your object
    
place into new file,



general rule of thumb

once is fine, twice is okay, three times is a warning, four times is definitely a refactor


comment your code as if someone were to read it as a note from an author about a book. 
    
don't explain it, the code already does that
instead leave higher level comments
if you use explanatory comments you will neglect good naming and good refactoring
if you trust comments you'll find yourself making assumptions about things that might not be true anymore,
,
comments are pretty rare tbh,
rm comments that are commented out code,

li 160 - 162 + li 13
this only works for you, make it a dynamic route and create the folder/route automatically

li 68
spread out array
spread out object
place each obj property on new line with comma at end
    
do this for all objects
might be limited in python
